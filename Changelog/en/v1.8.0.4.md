## Additions

- Marble Cave & Granite Cave Locators
- Accelerate Pumpkin Growth option

## BUG Fixes

- Fixed items appearing on player when Fishing Machine is working with incompatible mods enabled
- Fixed when inventory and big backpack are using the same keybind, pressing it will cause neither to open
- Fixed some operations may cause "crafting without ingredients" glitch when used with Guide's recipe browser
- Fixed some special ammo (such as coins and sand) could not be added to ammo chains
- Fixed ammo chains could not be added to weapons with zero damage

## Adjustments

- "Use Recall Items" will not use recall potions now if "Unlimited Potion" is off, even if it reaches the required amount
- Adjusted the anti-aliasing of SDF rounded rectangle boundaries in the UI, preventing excessive blurriness due to scaling. The border width of SUIText is no longer affected by scaling.
